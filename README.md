# Design Patterns

This repository is aimed to agregate content related to the main design patterns defined in the [GOF book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

Each pattern page has a description along with its class diagram, relationship with other patterns, tips to apply, sample code
and other topics to better comprehension of how it works.

The sample code was written in kotlin in a way to make it easy to urderstand.

Feel free to contribute by applying adjusts or pull requests with new patterns.

## GOF Patterns

### Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/abstractfactory)
2. [Factory Method](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/factorymethod)
3. [Singleton](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/singleton)

### Structural Patterns

Structural Design helps to make easy the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

1. [Adapter](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/adapter)
2. [Composite](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/composite)
3. [Decorator](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/decorator)
4. [Facade](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/facade)
5. [Proxy](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/proxy)

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns identifies common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. 
By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

1. [Command](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/commandpattern)
2. [Iterator](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/iterator)
3. [Observer](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/observer)
4. [State](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/statepattern)
5. [Strategy](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/strategy)
6. [Template Method](https://github.com/mauriiciobarbosa/designpatterns/tree/master/src/designpatterns/templatemethod)
